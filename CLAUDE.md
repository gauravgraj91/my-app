# Role
You are a senior full-stack engineer helping build and maintain a React + Firebase web app.
Your goal is to write clean, minimal, production-quality code that fits the existing codebase patterns.

# Instructions
- For design work (HTML mockups, superdesign), see `.superdesign/DESIGN_GUIDE.md`

# Project Conventions

## Stack
- React (no TypeScript), Firebase/Firestore backend
- Inline styles only — all styles as JS objects, no CSS modules
- Context API for state: `BillsContext` (useBills), `VendorsContext`
- Shared utilities: `src/utils/formatters.js` (formatCurrency, formatDate)

## Key Files
- `src/components/shop/shop.js` — main tab router
- `src/components/shop/BillsView.js` — bills table
- `src/components/shop/VendorsView.js` — vendors table
- `src/components/shop/BillCreateModal.js` — bill creation modal
- `src/firebase/billService.js` — Firestore CRUD for bills
- `src/firebase/vendorService.js` — Firestore CRUD for vendors + subcollections

## Coding Rules
- Match existing inline style patterns; never introduce CSS modules or styled-components
- Reuse `formatCurrency` / `formatDate` from formatters.js — don't reimplement
- Reuse `SummaryCard` from `src/components/ui/SummaryCard.js` — don't redefine locally
- Reuse `SortableHeader` from `src/components/ui/SortableHeader.js` (props: `sortField`, `sortDirection`, `handleSort`)
- Keep components in `src/components/shop/` unless clearly cross-cutting
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Don't add comments, docstrings, or type annotations to code you didn't change

## Commands
- `npm start` — start dev server (port 3000)
- `npm run build` — production build (output: `/build`)
- `npm test` — run tests with React Testing Library (Jest)

## Gotchas
- Firebase config reads from `.env` — never hardcode keys; all vars prefixed `REACT_APP_`
- Categories and vendors are stored in `localStorage`, not Firestore — don't try to fetch them from the DB
- `shop.js` is ~1600 lines; read the relevant section before editing, don't assume structure
- MUI has been removed — inline styles only, no MUI/Emotion imports
- Deployed on Vercel; `vercel.json` has SPA rewrites — don't modify it without good reason
- `react-scripts` (Create React App) is the build tool — no custom webpack config

## TODO — Improvements Backlog

### P1 — High (do soon)
- [ ] **Add Firebase Authentication** — no auth currently; anyone with the Firebase config can read/write all data. Add at least anonymous auth + Firestore security rules.

### P2 — Medium (nice to have)
- [ ] **Remove or commit to Tailwind** — `tailwindcss` is in devDeps but used across 15 files; too entrenched to remove quickly
- [ ] **Limit HomeView product subscription** — `subscribeToShopProducts` loads all products for the dashboard; create a lightweight stats query or limit the subscription

### P3 — Low (future)
- [ ] **Add React.lazy() for route code splitting** — all pages load eagerly in `App.js`
- [ ] **Clean up or integrate `VirtualizedBillsList.js`** — built but never imported
- [ ] **Consider IndexedDB for activity logs** — localStorage has ~5MB shared limit
