# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a React-based web application that includes several features:

1. Todo List: A simple task management system where users can add, edit, and delete tasks.

2. Shop Transactions: A feature to track cash inflows and outflows for a shop, allowing users to add transactions, filter them, and view totals.

3. Price List: (Assumed based on the imports in TodoList.js) A component to display and manage prices for items.

The application uses Material-UI components for styling and layout, and incorporates Tailwind CSS for additional styling capabilities. It also utilizes React hooks for state management and UUID for generating unique identifiers.

Key technologies and libraries used:
- React
- Material-UI
- Tailwind CSS
- UUID

This project demonstrates the implementation of common web application features and showcases the integration of popular React libraries and styling solutions.
